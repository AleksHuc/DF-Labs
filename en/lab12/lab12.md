### 1. Forensic analysis of computer memory

In general, a computer according to [von Neumann architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture) consists of a central processing unit, memory and input/output devices.

We usually perform forensic analysis on disks, but in the case of encrypted disks, we cannot access the data if we do not know the key to access the data. In order to analyze an encrypted disk, we must first analyze the memory and find the encryption key in it. The memory also contains passwords, temporary files and other temporary settings.

In order to get to the data in the memory of a well-protected, locked and encrypted computer, we need to perform a [Cold Boot attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack).

Every computer has memory in which it stores temporary files, files that are currently in use and environmental variables, as well as operating system and program settings. Memory consists of cells that contain capacitors that hold a charge that can be used to store data. The data is stored in the capacitor when we have power and the charge in the capacitor can be refreshed frequently. When we turn off the power supply, the recharging or the data stops, but the charge remains in the capacitors for some time. How long depends on the construction of the capacitor, the properties of the materials and the temperature. The lower the temperature, the longer the charge remains in the capacitor and the higher the temperature, the faster the charge is lost.

The goal of a Cold Boot attack is to try to cool down the memory as much as possible with [liquid nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_nitrogen) or [freeze spray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_spray) to the lowest possible temperature. Once the memory has cooled, we quickly transfer it to another working computer and read it. In this way, we can make an image of the memory, which can then be used for further analysis.

We need a customized computer that allows connecting and reading the memory during operation, since computers usually erase their memory when they are turned on and/or turned off. This property depends on how [BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS)/[UEFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI) initializes memory.

To read specific memory, we need a processor controller and motherboard dedicated to the correct type of memory. Today, the most common type of memory is the [Double Data Rate (DDR)](Double_data_rate) version [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM), [4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR4_SDRAM) and [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR5_SDRAM).

The computer starts up by receiving power, which triggers the [program counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_counter) to be set to its default value, through which the BIOS/UEFI boots, which take care of verifying and starting the hardware. It then hands off execution to the [bootloader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloader), which takes care of booting the operating system.

In an ideal world, you would write your own BIOS/UEFI that would not destroy the data in the memory and allow reading without initialization. However, BIOS/UEFI is usually a closed software that is written on a separate memory on the motherboard and is difficult to change. But we can write any bootloader that would allow us to do this, since it is just a piece of any software located on any disk. We don't want to read the memory anymore while the operating system is booting and running, because it is the only one using the memory and has already allocated a lot of important locations. Examples of modified bootloaders are:
- [msramdump](https://github.com/Schramp/msramdump)
- [memimage](https://citp.princeton.edu/our-work/memory/code)

In order to defend against a Cold Boot attack, we should not have confidential data stored in memory, such as an encryption key. The processor has specially separated registers and a small memory that is difficult to access, does not lose data during power loss and is intended to store confidential data. Separate memory is managed by a dedicated separate processor with dedicated software and communicates with the main processor via an agreed upon protocol. This functionality is known on Intel processors under the name [Intel Management Engine (IME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine) and on AMD processors under the name [Platform Security Processor (PSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Platform_Security_Processor) or [Microsoft Pluto](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2020/11/17/meet-the-microsoft-pluton-processor-the-security-chip-designed-for-the-future-of-windows-pcs/). This begs the question, if do we trust a closed system to look after our confidential data? Similar functionality is also performed by [smart cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card), which are connected to a computer via an input/output controller and contain their own separate processor that performs a similar functionality to an IME and PSP.

We have a large amount of memory on our computer and now we will see how we can access individual parts of it. Modern operating systems use virtual memory, which resides in memory and also extends to disk, and is defined by a [page table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table). We can make a copy of the entire memory, where the operating system, all programs, current files, settings and environment are located, and then analyze it. But we can focus on the memory of an individual program and find out what it has in memory, which files it has open, how it is executed, and the like.

We have dedicated tools for analyzing program memory:
- Windows: [mimiKatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz)
- Linux: [volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility), [rekall](https://github.com/google/rekall), [yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara)

But we can try to analyze and change the program memory ourselves. Let's install a program for downloading videos from the web [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and use it to download two videos from the web and save them with the same format. We play them with the program [`vlc`](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/).

With the command [`ps`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ps.1.html) we can list all the processes currently running in our operating system. The label `PID - Process Identifier` identifies each process and allows us to manage it.

    ps -a

         PID TTY          TIME CMD
        1061 tty2     00:00:00 gnome-session-b
        3305 pts/1    00:00:00 su
        3306 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
        3404 pts/0    00:00:06 vlc
        3469 pts/1    00:00:00 ps


Linux has a virtual directory `/dev` which addresses all devices, `/sys` which addresses modules, subsystems and non-process settings and [`/proc`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html) which addresses all currently running processes.

The `mem` file addresses the entire virtual memory of the process as seen by the process itself with relative offsets. When we try to save it, it returns an error because it tries to read parts of the memory that don't exist.

    cat /proc/3404/mem > /home/aleks/vlcmemdump.raw

    cat: /proc/3404/mem: Input/output error

The `maps` file tells us which parts of the virtual memory in the `mem` file are used by the process and allows us to further analyze the process memory. The first two numbers represent the part of the memory that the line addresses (the address of the first byte and the address of the first byte after the last byte of the memory part in hexadecimal), followed by permissions and information about the file (offset, device, inode and name). Addresses that point to the `/usr/bin/...` folder tell you which program is running. Memory starts with the program code, constants, local and dynamic variables, then comes free memory, and finally we have the stack and return address.

Now we can write a short program that prints the entire memory of the process according to the contents of the `mem` and `maps` files, or we can download the [program](https://davidebove.com/blog/2021/03/27/how-to-dump-process-memory-in-linux/?pk_campaign=feed&pk_kwd=reverse-engineering-android-apps) from the web and run it for the desired `PID`. The result is a binary file that represents the memory of the process and is intended for further analysis.

    wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Dbof/b9244cfc607cf2d33438826bee6f5056/raw/aa4b75ddb55a58e2007bf12e17daadb0ebebecba/memdump.py

The `fd` directory contains symbolic links, named with numbers, to the open files of this process. Symbolic links allow us to open a file and read it, even if the file was deleted from the disk in the meantime. To find out where the symbolic links point to, use the `ls -al` command and see that the number 32 points to the video that is currently playing.

The memory of the program can also be examined with the program [`radare2`](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2). With the setting `v` we enable the graphic interface and then by clicking on the menu `View\Hexdump`, where we can inspect the contents of the memory.

    apt update
    apt install git
    git clone https://github.com/radareorg/radare2
    radare2/sys/install.sh

For example, we can also examine the memory of the `nano` text editor. By opening it and writing any text in it and leaving it open. Then we check the editor's `PID` with the `ps` command and make a copy of the memory with the `memdump.py` script. The contents of the memory can then be written out with the command [`strings`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strings.1.html) and then filtered with the command [`grep`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html) by a keyword, for example `test`. Other more advanced programs can also extract the data structures used by the process from the memory copy.

The [`gdb`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gdb.1.html) debugger allows us to attach to the currently running process. When we connect to the process, it just stops and waits to run the next command. The further execution of the process can be initiated with the command `continue` and then with the command `CTRL+C` the execution can be stopped again. The command `where` tells us where we are in memory. With the `disassemble` command, we can look at the program code of individual functions. With the `frame` command, we can print values in memory, such as the heap, the stack, and other variables and data structures.

Now let's try to write a program that connects to the video playback process via the `gdb` debugger. It then looks for a file descriptor to the currently playing video file. It closes the current video file and opens a new video file under its file descriptor, causing the player to start playing a new video clip. Problems arise when we use different formats for video files and in this case the program reports an error. Our program can be summarized by the following [example]((https://sajjanrajjain.wordpress.com/2015/08/29/changing-file-descriptors-in-gdb/).).

We use the command [`chmod`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chmod.1.html) to change the access rights of our two video files so that they can be read by any program. Next, we create our program that will receive two arguments. The first argument `NAMEKEY` represents the full or partial name of the video file to be played. The second argument `NEWFILE` represents the path and name of the file we want to play. In the next step, we get the `PID` of the video player and then get the `FD` file descriptor to the currently playing video file. To change the video file in the video player process, we use the `gdb` tool. First, we attach to the process with the `attach` command. Within the process, we now open a new video file with the system call [`open`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html), which returns file descriptor under which an open file is now available. Using the system call [`dup2`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/dup.2.html) we clone the file descriptor from the currently playing file to a new file that we just opened it. Finally, disconnect from the process with the `detach` command and then close the `gdb` tool with the `quit` command.

Let's also change the rights of our program so that they now allow execution. We start the video player with the first video clip and then run our program with the correct parameters.    

    chmod 666 Norway.webm
    chmod 666 Slovenia.webm

    nano switcher

    NAMEKEY=$1
    NEWFILE=$2

    echo $PID

    FD=$(ls -al /proc/$PID/fd | grep $NAMEKEY | cut -d " " -f 9 )
    echo $FD

    echo -e "attach $PID\ncall open(\"$NEWFILE\", 0666)\ncall (int)dup2(\$1, $FD)\ndetach\nquit\n" | gdb
